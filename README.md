# stock-analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this challenge was to reconstruct the code we created in the module to make it run more efficient. We wanted to compare 2017 and 2018 Returns to see if the stocks were worth investing in
## Results
From the code results we can see that 2017 yielded much better returns than 2018 in general.
### Execution Times
We can see that by refractoring the code the performance was much faster, see below for year 2018 comparisons:

## Summary
Refactoring this code made the performance a lot faster; however, refactoring is a time consuming process. The code yields the same results, only cutting down the run time by more than a second.
### Pros and Cons of Refactoring
#### Pros
Refactoring makes the code a lot more easy to understand. It's also a lot easier for maintanence and debugging purposes
#### Cons
Refactoring is very time consuming, especially if you don't know if it will have an overwhelming effect on the code you're writing
